  <p> <font color="white">Fashion is something we deal with everyday. Even people who say they don’t care what they wear choose
 clothes every morning that say a lot about them and how they feel that day.One certain thing in the fashion 
 world is change. We are constantly being bombarded with new fashion ideas from music, videos, books, and
 television. Movies also have a big impact on what people wear. Ray-Ban sold more sunglasses after the movie
 Men In Black. Sometimes a trend is world-wide. Back in the 1950s, teenagers everywhere dressed like Elvis Presley.<br></font>
<b> Who dictates fashion?</b><br>
 <font color="white">Musicians and other cultural icons have always influenced what we’re wearing, but so have political figures and
 royalty. Newspapers and magazines report on what Hillary Clinton wears. The recent death of Diana, the Princess
 of Wales, was a severe blow to the high fashion world, where her clothes were daily news.Even folks in the 1700s
  pored over fashion magazines to see the latest styles. Women and dressmakers outside the French courtrelied on
  sketches to see what was going on. The famous French King Louis XIV said that fashion is a mirror. Louis himself
  was renowned for his style, which tended towards extravagant laces and velvets.</font><br><b>Clothes separate people into groups.</b><br>
 <font color="white"> In high school, groups have names: “goths, skaters, preps, herbs.” Styles show who you are, but they also create
  stereotypes and distance between groups. For instance, a businessman might look at a boy with green hair and multiple
  piercings as a freak and outsider. But to another person, the boy is a strict conformist. He dresses a certain way 
  to deliver the message of rebellion and separation, but within that group, the look is uniform. Acceptance or rejection
  of a style is a reaction to the society we live in.
 

 

Fashion is revealing. Clothes reveal what groups people are in.
